My code is in C++. I did all of it on UCI's OpenLab, so I would recommend having that open (or something similar). I don't have an executable, just the cpp file, so you will need to build it like a normal cpp file. You don't have to spell any commands. I have it set to open the init-dp.txt & input-dp.txt file, write to output-dp.txt, and close on its own. If you want to test it for no demand paging, you'll have to change the file names. I left 3 comments that mark where you'll have to change the file. Please let me know if you have any trouble. I can do a demonstration. 

Aside from this file, the zip file inlcudes:
	~ project2.hpp
		* This is the header file for the main program. I included all of my declarations in here.
	~ project2.cpp
		* This is the main file (the one to run). It includes implementations of all the functions I declared in the hpp.
	~ output-dp.txt
		* This is the output file that includes the results for demand paging.
	~ output-no-dp.txt
		* This is the output file that excludes demand paging.
